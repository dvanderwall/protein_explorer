## Overview

Protein Explorer is a sophisticated platform designed to help researchers explore protein structures, analyze phosphorylation sites, and understand kinase-substrate relationships. The application integrates multiple data sources including AlphaFold protein structures, UniProt data, and custom phosphosite structural similarity databases to provide deep insights into protein phosphorylation mechanisms.

### Key Features

- **Protein Structure Visualization**: Interactive 3D visualization of AlphaFold protein structures
- **Phosphosite Analysis**: Identification and analysis of potential phosphorylation sites
- **Structural Similarity Networks**: Visualization of structurally similar phosphosites
- **Sequence Similarity Analysis**: Identification of sequence-similar phosphosites
- **Kinase Prediction**: Structure-based and sequence-based kinase predictions
- **Motif Conservation**: Analysis of conserved sequence patterns around phosphosites
- **Interactive Data Exploration**: Rich interactive visualizations and filtering capabilities

## Architecture

The application follows a classic web application architecture with:

### Core Components

1. **Flask Web Application** (`web_app/app.py`): The main server that handles HTTP requests and serves the application
2. **Analysis Modules** (`protein_explorer/analysis/`): Core analytical functionality for proteins and phosphorylation sites
3. **Data Modules** (`protein_explorer/data/`): Handles data loading, caching, and retrieval from external sources
4. **Visualization Modules** (`protein_explorer/visualization/`): Generates visualizations for protein structures and networks
5. **Templates** (`web_app/templates/`): HTML templates for the user interface
6. **Static Files** (`web_app/static/`): JavaScript, CSS, and other static assets

### Data Flow

1. User submits a query (protein identifier or phosphosite)
2. Flask app routes the request to the appropriate handler
3. Data is retrieved from external sources (UniProt, AlphaFold) or local databases
4. Analysis modules process the data
5. Results are visualized through templates and client-side JavaScript
6. Interactive visualizations are rendered in the browser

## Data Sources and Integration

### External Data Sources

- **AlphaFold**: Provides protein structure predictions
- **UniProt**: Provides protein sequence and annotation data
- **PhosphositePlus**: Reference data for known phosphorylation sites and kinases

### Internal Databases

- **Structural Similarity Database**: Precomputed RMSD values between phosphosites
- **Sequence Similarity Database**: Precomputed sequence similarity scores
- **Kinase Prediction Scores**: Precomputed structure and sequence-based kinase scores

### MySQL Integration (Remote SQL Database)

Protein Explorer uses a remote MySQL database hosted on Google Cloud SQL to manage and query structured data in real time. This database replaces earlier local file-based storage (e.g., .feather, .parquet) for certain datasets, enabling:
- Faster querying and analysis from the web app
- Centralized storage across different deployments
- Scalable infrastructure for large datasets

#### How it works
All SQL interactions are managed via a secure SQLAlchemy-based connector (cloud_sql_connector.py). The app uses in-memory caching (via Python dictionaries) to store recent query results during a session. There is no reliance on local disk caching anymore—only remote SQL and memory. If access to the remote database fails to be established, the application falls back to the local disk caching system.

### Data Loading and Caching

The application implements efficient data loading and caching strategies:

1. **Remote SQL Queries**: Primary source of all structured data
2. **In-Memory Caching**: Frequently accessed query results are cached in memory
3. **Progressive Loading**: Large datasets are loaded incrementally and on-demand

If the remote database access fails, the application falls back to the local caching systems: 

1. **Preloading**: Critical data is preloaded at application startup
2. **Local Caching**: Downloaded structures and data are cached locally
3. **In-Memory Caching**: Frequently accessed data is cached in memory
4. **Progressive Loading**: Data is loaded progressively as needed

## Key Analysis Features

### Phosphosite Identification

Identifies potential phosphorylation sites (S, T, Y residues) in protein sequences and analyzes their structural contexts. For each phosphosite, the application calculates:

- Mean pLDDT score (confidence metric from AlphaFold)
- Number of nearby residues within 10Å
- Surface accessibility
- Sequence motif (-7 to +7 positions)
- Comparison with known phosphorylation sites

### Structural Similarity Analysis

Compares the 3D structure of phosphorylation sites to identify similar binding patterns:

- RMSD-based structural similarity calculations
- Interactive network visualization of similar sites
- Filtering by RMSD threshold
- Detailed comparison of structural features

### Sequence Similarity Analysis

Analyzes sequence patterns around phosphorylation sites:

- Sequence similarity scoring
- Motif conservation analysis
- Position-specific amino acid distributions
- N-terminal and C-terminal region analysis

### Kinase Prediction

Predicts potential kinases for phosphorylation sites based on:

1. **Structure-based prediction**: Using structural similarity to known kinase substrates
2. **Sequence-based prediction**: Using sequence patterns recognized by specific kinases
3. **Combined analysis**: Integration of both approaches for more robust predictions
